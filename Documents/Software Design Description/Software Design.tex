This screen is the main menu for the Game, it is divided in half with one half related to the game of Hearts, and the other half for the game of Spades.  Each half includes three buttons, “Join Private”, “Join Public” and “Create New”.  The “Join Private” brings up Screen 4, which allows the user enter the name of the game they want to join.  The “Join Public” will tell the server to assign the user to the first available  public game, if no game is available the server will create a new game with the user and three AI players.
